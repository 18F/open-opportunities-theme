========================

The goal of Open Opportunities is to foster a network of federal employees that will lead to a more effective, efficient, responsive government by sharing skills and collaborating on projects that support the mission of an agency or the government as a whole.

[Open Opportunities](http://gsablogs.gsa.gov/dsic/category/open-opportunities/) started as a thriving community using a simple WordPress implementation, which was effective for its initial pilot. To support its rapid growth, it has moved to the [OpenOpps open source platform](https://github.com/18F/openopps-platform) -- this repository will host custom configuration is for the US federal government theme for Open Opportunities.

We keep all issues about Open Opportunities, whether it be about the platform or the theme here: https://github.com/18F/openopps-platform/issues
